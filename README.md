In the modern digital world, electronic mail (email) has become one of the most important communication mediums used in every field — education, business, government, and personal life. Billions of emails are exchanged daily across the world for various purposes such as marketing, official communication, notifications, and social interaction.
However, along with the benefits of email, there has been a rapid increase in spam emails — unwanted, irrelevant, or malicious messages sent in bulk without the recipient’s consent.

Spam emails not only waste time and resources but also pose serious security risks by spreading phishing links, malware, advertisements, fake news, and scams. According to recent studies, more than 45% of all emails sent globally are spam. Thus, automatically identifying and filtering these unwanted emails is essential for improving online safety and communication efficiency.

To address this problem, modern systems employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to develop intelligent email spam detection systems that can learn and adapt to new spam patterns dynamically.
Email spam detection refers to the process of automatically identifying and categorizing incoming email messages as either “spam” (unwanted or malicious) or “ham” (legitimate and useful).
The main objective is to prevent spam emails from reaching the user’s inbox while ensuring that genuine emails are not mistakenly classified as spam.

Traditionally, spam detection was implemented using rule-based filters, where administrators manually defined rules such as blocking specific keywords (“win money”, “free offer”) or sender domains.
However, these methods have serious limitations:

Spammers can easily bypass fixed rules by changing the wording or email structure.

Rule-based systems cannot learn from new data.

They require constant manual updates.

Therefore, AI and ML-based systems are now preferred, as they can automatically learn from historical data and identify hidden patterns that distinguish spam from legitimate emails.
